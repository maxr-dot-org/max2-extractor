Game asset extractor for Mechanized Assault & Exploration 2 ("M.A.X 2")
=======================================================================

[M.A.X 2](https://www.gog.com/game/m_a_x_m_a_x_2) was an 2d strategy/RTS game released by Interplay in 1998.

By then standards, game was considered burdened by outdated gameplay design and frustrating lack of polish.

But I've always remembered it as insanely atmospheric vision of distant future, with humanity reduced to role of unwilling pawns fighting wars for enigmatic alien force known as Concord.

This project is both nostalgia trip and Rust learning exercise.
